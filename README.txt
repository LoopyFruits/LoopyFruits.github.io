This is a landing page for people who forget the "/reachme" in the URL.

The goal was to be simplistic, as well as practicing some simple animations I had just learned about.

The idea behind animating everything was to keep the consumer's attention, as the page starts out blank,
if I chose not to animate anything it would look weird I think, just some static text on a page. That's
pretty uninteresting if you ask me. Though because of the animation, the viewer's eyes are constantly
drawn back to the page, it turns a simple design into one full of life.

Each animation was carefully thought out beforehand. With the underline growing from the side line, the
header section growing up from the line all give the idea the site is building itself. Then once it is
done I specifically chose to animate a bit of a bounce into the serif font's that show up last. This was
to mimic the more expressive style of serif, with a more expressive animation. This means these links
are the important ones and you should click on them!

Those are some of the thoughts behind this landing page.

So really it's an idiot re-director, or if I'm too lazy to send someone the full link.

At least it's stylish.
